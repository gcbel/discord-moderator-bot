## Background
Financial scams on dating platforms target victims by setting up desirable online profiles (e.g. catfishing) that are designed to con targets out of money. Cryptocurrency scams are a rising subset. In 2022 alone, 70,000 people in the U.S. reported being caught in a romance scam, with reported losses hitting a staggering $1.3 billionٖٖ (1). 

Adults under 30 are the most prominent group on dating platforms and 6x more likely to be targets of dating apps scams than adults over 30 (2)(3). A second victim is the individual whose images are stolen; they can face harassment for being dragged into the abuse of others online.

Resolving this issue is a popular user demand (4).
